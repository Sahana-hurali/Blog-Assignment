            <p>Medium is an open platform that exists to share ideas and perspectives from the world’s most insightful writers, thinkers, and storytellers. <br /><br />
Today, we are updating our Rules. As Medium evolves as a product, so do the ways people use it. To accommodate this, we regularly assess our rules, and adjust them accordingly.<br /><br />
Changes today include strengthening our rules regarding content that violates the Terms of Service of Medium or other third parties, and our policies on copyright.<br /><br />

            <h2>Improving Discovery on Medium with Tags</h2>
           <h3>Check out the new tag pages</h3>
            <p>Recently we’ve launched some updates to the tag pages on the web to improve discovery. <br /><br />
            Tags are keywords and keyword phrases that are added to stories by the writer to improve story discovery and categorization. A writer can add up to five tags per story.<br /><br />
